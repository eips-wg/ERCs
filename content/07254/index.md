## Abstract

With the aspiration of bringing forth unique functionality and enhancing value for holders of [ERC-20](../00020.md) tokens, our project aims to effortlessly reward token holders without necessitating users to lock, stake, or farm their tokens. Whenever the project generates profits, these profits can be distributed to the token holders.

Revenue Sharing is an extended version of [ERC-20](../00020.md). It proposes an additional payment method for token holders. 

This standard includes updating rewards for holders and allowing token holders to withdraw rewards.

Potential use cases encompass:

* Companies distributing dividends to token holders.
* Direct sharing of revenue derived from business activities, such as marketplaces, Automated Market Makers (AMMs), and games.
